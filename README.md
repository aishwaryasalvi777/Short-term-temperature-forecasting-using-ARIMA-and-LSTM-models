# Short-Term Temperature Forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM

## 📋 Project Overview
This is a comprehensive time series forecasting project that compares **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for predicting short-term temperature changes across US cities. The project combines statistical analysis with deep learning approaches to determine optimal forecasting methodologies.
